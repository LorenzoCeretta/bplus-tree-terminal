# B+ Tree: Development & Notes

This document contains notes and plans for implementing a B+ Tree data structure, including the core concepts and development roadmap.

## 1. B+ Tree Concepts

### What is a B+ Tree?

A B+ Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that's great for handling large amounts of data. The key thing that makes it special is that all the actual data is stored only in the leaf nodes. The middle nodes (internal nodes) just help guide us to the right place.

B+ Trees are used in databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL, and even in file systems like the ones in macOS, Linux and Windows.

### Main Properties

- Order (m): Controls how many children a node can have. Each node must have between m/2 (rounded up) and m children.
- Internal Nodes: Only contain keys that help guide the search - like a roadmap.
- Leaf Nodes: Where the actual data lives. All leaves are connected to each other in a linked list, which makes it super fast to scan through ranges of data.

## 2. Project Structure

The implementation has three main classes:

- LeafNode: Stores the actual key-value pairs and links to its neighbor leaves.
- InternalNode: Acts as an index, storing keys that guide the search.
- BPlusTree: The main class that ties everything together. Has methods like insert, delete, and search.

## 3. Implementation

### 1: Core Logic

1. Basic Structure & Search

   - Build the three main classes
   - Implement the search method to look up values and leaf nodes

2. Insertion

   - Handle simple inserts when there's space
   - Handle cases where we need to split nodes to balance the tree

3. Deletion
   - Handle simple deletes
   - Handle cases where we need to redistribute keys
   - Handle cases where we need to merge nodes

### 2: Testing & Validation

- Test the core functionality
- Add tests for edge cases
- Make sure everything works as expected

## 4. File System

- Create a script that applies the B+ tree structure to manage a file system
- Build an interactive Python terminal interface that allows users to:
  - Navigate through directories
  - Create, update, and delete files and directories

## 5. Performance Analysis

- Design and run comprehensive benchmarks to measure operations performance and speeds
- Create visual representations of the results using graphs
- Compare performance with different tree orders and data sizes

## 6. Extras

- Build a visual interface to demonstrate terminal interaction and commands
- Handle cases where we need to redistribute keys between nodes in the insertion method
